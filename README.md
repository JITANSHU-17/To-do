## How It Works

FocusList stores tasks in the browser using LocalStorage.

Each task contains information such as:

```text
id
title
priority
completed
createdAt
```

Task operations update the React state, while the reusable `useLocalStorage` hook automatically saves the updated task list to LocalStorage.

Because there is no backend or database, task data is stored locally in the user's browser.

---

## Filtering

The application supports multiple filtering conditions.

Users can:

1. Search tasks by title.
2. Filter by completion status.
3. Filter by priority.
4. Combine these filters.

Filtering is performed against the underlying task data without modifying the original task collection.

---

## Responsive Design

The interface is designed for:

* Desktop
* Laptop
* Tablet
* Mobile devices

The layout adapts to smaller screen sizes while keeping task controls usable.

---

## Accessibility

FocusList includes several accessibility considerations:

* Semantic HTML elements
* Accessible labels for interactive controls
* Keyboard navigation
* Visible keyboard focus states
* `aria-label` and `aria-pressed` where appropriate
* Clear distinction between completed and active tasks
* Sufficiently clear visual hierarchy

---

## Performance

FocusList is a lightweight frontend application.

Performance considerations include:

* No backend requests
* No unnecessary external APIs
* Minimal dependencies
* Local data storage
* Derived filtering using React memoization
* Vite production build optimization

---

## Development Workflow

The project was developed incrementally using feature-based Git commits.

Example commit history:

```text
chore: initialize React Vite project
feat: add FocusList application layout
feat: implement task creation and management
feat: add task editing
feat: add search and task filtering
feat: persist tasks with local storage
style: improve responsive UI and accessibility
docs: add project documentation
```

This approach keeps the development history organized and makes individual changes easier to understand.

---

## Future Improvements

Possible future improvements include:

* Drag-and-drop task ordering
* Due dates
* Task categories
* Dark mode
* Task sorting
* Import/export tasks
* Additional productivity statistics
* Optional cloud synchronization
